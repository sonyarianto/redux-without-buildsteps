# redux-without-buildsteps

Learning Redux sometimes hard, even still hard for me, even harder if we just learn and never use it. That's why I create simple example on this repository about using Redux and remove all complexity, just pure how it works, no CSS things, no import things, no `npm install` things, just sit, read, analyze and focus. Every sample is on its own HTML file and on that each single file will contains all code.

## Installation
No, no need to install anything. We just use everything from CDN.

## Should I do the `npm install` things?
Why? Do you want the `npm install` things hahaha. No need to do that, even we don't need web server to run the html file.

## What is Redux?
Redux is predictable state management bla bla bla, waitttt.... just go to https://redux.js.org/

## What is included in this repo?

I have 3 (three) files here, no need `npm install` or anything, just html files that has a demo of how to setup and using Redux. So basically you can just run using local web server or even you don't need a web server, just run each of html on your browser via file system.

- `redux-with-react.html`, show you Redux with React, basically the old school Redux.
- `redux-with-react-and-react-redux.html`, show you Redux with React and React Redux (the React binding to Redux).
- `redux-with-react-and-react-redux-and-redux-toolkit.html`, show you modern Redux nowdays, using React, React Redux and Redux Toolkit (this is the recommended way today).
